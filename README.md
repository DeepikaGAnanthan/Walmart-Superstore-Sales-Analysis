Walmart sales Analysis using Power BI:

Problem Statement:
The Walmart Superstore wants to analyze its sales data to gain insights into its
performance and identify opportunities for growth. The company has a vast amount of
sales data, including information on products, customers, stores, and transactions. The
main objective is to extract meaningful insights from this data to analyse the overall sales
of walmart superstore.

For this project, I’ve developed a dashboard to analyze data for Walmart stores, opting to use Microsoft’s Power BI as the tool of choice. Power BI was chosen for its user-friendly interface, robust data organization capabilities, and its ability to create complex charts and graphs. These features enable us to gain valuable insights from the data efficiently.
